    content: `<p>When kids learn about different Sustainable Development Goals and how they are interrelated, they develop a better understanding of the world. Learning about global challenges our community faces such as poverty, inequality and climate change, they become more aware of what’s happening around the world and develop empathy and compassion. For example, learning about Goal 10 (reducing inequality) will help children understand the importance of respecting people regardless of race, ethnicity, sex, sexual orientation, background and other characteristics.</p>
    <p>Children form core values, attitudes and habits at an early age and these values can persist for a long time. When we teach children about Sustainable Development Goals such as gender equality, quality education and responsible consumption, they grow up conscious and ready to contribute to achieving SDGs by 2030.</p>
    <p>Child participation is one of the guiding principles of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. They have the right to participate in all matters affecting them within their communities, families, and schools. When children learn about the SDGs, they also learn about different actions they can take in everyday life in order to contribute to achieving those goals. This will help them feel motivated and encourage their meaningful participation in society. Children will feel inspired to create a better future for the world. In addition, community engagement will give children a sense of belonging which is crucial to the building of their identity.</p>
    <p>If we want our nations and communities to grow and prosper, then we all will have to bet on children and youth and their contribution. The aim of Educacion Diversa is to provide art-based educational materials for children to learn about SDGs. With our educational materials on SDGs, they will be able to learn in a playful and engaging way. We hope this will inspire them to become global leaders and vote every day about the kind of world they want to live in. </p>`,

    excerpt: "In 1993, the United Nations (UN) General Assembly defined violence against women as “any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women” (United Nations, 1993). In real terms this...",

    content: `<p>In 1993, the United Nations (UN) General Assembly defined violence against women as “any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women” (United Nations, 1993). In real terms this includes violence in domestic and inter-personal relationships; many forms of sexual violence including rape and sexual assault; systemic, institutional and culture based forms of violence; and new emerging forms of harassment and stalking based in modern technology. </p>
    <p>In this context, experience has demonstrated that women are significantly more likely to experience GBV than men. It has also shown that working with men, as partners, is critical to the prevention of and response to GBV. </p>
    <p>But why is important to work with men to address GBV? Work with men and boys can have a positive, transformative impact for the lives of women and girls, but also for the lives of men and boys. There is a much broader spectrum of positive roles for men and boys to play than perpetrator or potential perpetrator of gender-based violence. These roles not only prevent and reduce violence against women, but also improve the lives of men and boys by freeing them from these harmful and limiting aspects of masculinities. As a result, we can eliminate gender inequalities that hold back the development of our communities and nation, and ensure that women and girls that men care about do not have to live a life in fear of violence.</p>
    <p>And what are some benefits for men of getting engage in elimination of GBV? Better relationships, better health; Not being lumped into a stereotypical group of "men", not having to conform to negative aspects of masculinity; More freedom to pursue any activities in which they are interested; People men care about (mothers, sisters, girlfriends, aunts, etc) have a lesser chance of being harmed by violence and other gender inequities; Not bullied by other men for stepping outside the gender “box”; Less pressure to be the sole provider and protector, more economic prosperity for all. </p>
    <p>Achieving gender equality is a societal responsibility that must fully engage both men and women. Men need to be addressed as part of the solution, not just part of the problem. They need to be invited and challenged to critically reflect on the existence of patriarchy, male power and privilege; to analyze the costs to women and girls, but also the costs to men and boys. Finally, men and boys also need to be shown the benefits of gender equality, to women, girls, and all of humanity.</p>`,

    title: "How to talk to kids about body safety and consent",
    excerpt: "Moreover, many parents  and caregivers often wait until their children are older to talk about sexual consent. What they are missing on is the fact that sexual consent is not just in relation to intercourse. Waiting until your child is ready to become sexually active...",
    slug: "How-to-talk-to-kids-about-body-safety-and-consent",
    image: "/images/static/examples/blogs/blogpost3.png",
    content: `<p>“How about a hug?” a relative asked my daughter the other day, her negative response at first was shutdown, “Come on, it’s only a hug and I miss you”.</p>
    <p>This is when I said, “It’s ok, you can go and play, and if you want to come back and give a hug, you can. But you don’t have to.”</p>
    <p>You see, what kind of messages are we giving our children when we are telling them that they have to say Yes and give consent to physical touch when it comes to certain people, because they are relatives, or friends, or it’s socially not ok to turn them down, when at the same time we are telling them that they have the power to say NO?</p>
    <p>Moreover, many parents  and caregivers often wait until their children are older to talk about sexual consent. What they are missing on is the fact that sexual consent is not just in relation to intercourse. Waiting until your child is ready to become sexually active before you start talking about consent, may place your child in vulnerable situation in relation to any unwanted physical touch.</p>
    <p>One in four girls and one in 20 boys are sexually abused before the age of 18, and about 35 percent of sexual abuse victims are under 12 years old—elementary school age. And in a 2018 national survey, over 80 percent of women and 40 percent of men reported experiencing some form of sexual harassment or assault in their lifetime. </p>
    <p>This said, sitting down a toddler to explain to them what sexual abuse is, will most probably just confuse and scare them. 
      So how and when to talk about keeping safe? I truly believe we need to teach safe, protective education and consent from the age of 3, using really clear, simple messages that do not aim to scare those children.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Start with using correct words for all body parts. 
    </li>
    <p>This should happen actually from day 1, as we are changing nappies for the infant, we start by mentioning that we are now cleaning the penis, the vulva, and the bottom. Those are body parts just like the nose, knees, or hands. Those parts are not unacceptable, taboos or have purely sexual connotations, it’s our perception of them that makes them as such.</p>
    <p>The reason why this is important, is that research has shown that children who are confident in using the proper names of those body parts are much more likely to tell if something inappropriate happens.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, it shows sexual predators that the child and his parents talk about this at home and hence adds another obstacle to the abuse.</p>
    <li>Introduce the concept of consent.</li>
    <p>Kids need to feel fully in control of their bodies and hence it is important to make it a habbit to ask your children if you can touch them, even for a cuddle or a hug. We explain to our 2-3 year old that I need to touch their private part to clean after they have done a poo if they have not mastered that yet or they are still in their nappy.
      We also repeat that they have the power to say NO and everyone regardless of who they are, have to respect our NO and we in turn have to accept and respect the NO coming from others.</p>
    <p>This leads us to point number 3.</p>
    <li>Don’t force hugs and kisses.</li>
    <p>We can’t emphasise how important it is to keep reminding children that they are the bosses of their own body. </p>
    <p>Stating that to them is not enough though.</p>
    <p>What kind of a message are we sending when we are telling them: “ you are the boss of your body” and then only 5-10 mins later to say “It’s not nice to say No to grandma, go give her a hug, she loves you”.</p>
    <p>Yes you guessed it, we are telling them that they are not really the boss of thei own bodies, because, Grandam and Grandpa and Uncle and Auntie and Grandma’s friend and our Neighbour X are allowed to give you hugs and kisses and make you feel uncomfortable even if you say NO!!!</p>
    <p>Hence, that molester who happens to also be someone I know (because 93% of the time they are) can touch me because they also love me? And it’s not ok to say no to someone I know who is showing me “affection”?</p>
    <p>You see where I am going with this?</p>
    <li>Teach kids to understand and trust their feelings</li>
    <p>Start by teaching children to identify and name their feelings and those of others. Whether through role plays, a fun memory matching game or sitting with them and talking about how they felt around a certain situation (whether happy or not).</p>
    <p>Let them identify where that feeling also was in their body, when I felt scared from the sound of the balloon popping my heart ached. Explain to them that if they ever feel uncomfortable, anxious, scared, etc because of someone or what they may have said or done, they need to come to you directly and that YOU WILL TRUST THEIR FEELINGS TOO no matter who that other person is.</p>
    <li>Teach them Safe VS Unsafe touches</li>
    <p>While you may be familiar with the “bad touch”, “good touch” concept, I personally along with others prefer not to use it as the word bad by itself (bad feeling, bad behaviour, bad person) has a deep routed meaning of shame and guilt.
      This may demotivate the child to tell so he won’t be associated with these two words. 
      Furthermore, this may cause confusion as not all perpetrators are violent or aggressive with their victims. Some are gentle which may cause an unwanted and rather instinctual “good feeling” for the child leading them to again wonder why is this “bad”? and should I feel ashamed that it did not feel “bad” for me?</p>
    <p>Hence, using terms such as safe and unsafe touches are easier for a child to understand and does not include a lot of misinterpretation. Just like it’s Unsafe to cross the traffic light when it is red, it’s unsafe for anyone to touch you on your private parts which include the: Penis, Scrotum, Vulva, Bottom, Chest, Breast, and Mouth, unless it’s the doctor in the presence and consent of your parents, your parents/carer if they are cleaning that area after a poo (up to a certain age…when they can be doing that independently).</p>
    <li>Teach your child Safe VS Unsafe secrets.</li>
    <p>Unsafe secrets are secrets that may put you or others at risk of getting hurt. </p>
    <p>Example of Unsafe Secrets:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>if they involve unsafe touches</li>
      <li>if they involve someone else being harmed</li>
      <li>being forced to look at pictures or videos that make them feel uncomfortable</li>
      <li>being asked to undress</li>
      <li>being forced to drink or eat or sniff something</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Make sure your child truly understands the difference. Provide them with scenarios of safe and unsafe secrets and let them tell you what they are.</p>
    <li>Help your child choose 3 to 5 trusted or safe adults (you included).</li>
    <p>Those are the people who they can go to if they feel unsafe. One must be present at school or childcare where the child spends his days and the others could be family members and friends. Make sure your child helps in choosing those people as they are the ones that need to feel completely comfortable and safe to approach those adults for help.</p>
    <p>Those safe adults need to show understanding, zero judgement and be proactive when it comes to what the child has said and not dismiss them in any way.</p>
    <li>Teach them and help them practice saying “NO, Stop It! I don’t like that!”</li>
    <p>These are not only words; you need to also teach them the posture that comes with it. Hands on hips, legs slightly apart, shoulders thrown back and head held high. This is a very empowering stance and should be practiced regularly and not only when facing molesters, but also with peers who are bullying. </p>
    <li>MOST IMPORTANTLY: it is never their fault, you will believe them no matter what.</li>
    <p>Assure them that they can come and talk to you about anything, not just through words, but also action. The phrase “You can tell me anything” loses its meaning if parents respond to questions or information from children with punishments, aggressive reactions, anger, or dismissiveness.</p>
  </ol>
  
  <p>Revisit this often. Children learn through repetition. This is not a “let’s sit down and talk this one time and be done with it” kind of matter. How many times do you remind children to look both ways before crossing the street, or to blow the hot food before eating?</p>
  <p>On a final note, here are some books that I recommend, or head to https://ranatayara.selz.com/pages/products and download our “I am the boss of my body” activity books (in English, Arabic or French).</p>

    content: `<p><b>The background (origins, personal story)</b></p>
    <p>Lydia María Cacho Rìbeiro was born in 1963 in Mexico City. She became a journalist at 23 years old, specializing in gender issues and human rights. She is a feminist and a human rights activist who has been keen on defending human rights from an early age. Thanks to her mother, who has been her source of inspiration, Lydia has dedicated her life to investigating and exposing human trafficking, sexual violence, organized crime, corruption, and impunity. Amnesty International described her as "perhaps Mexico's most famous investigative journalist and women's rights advocate." Cacho is the winner of numerous international awards for her journalism, including the Civil Courage Prize, the Wallenberg Medal, and the Olof Palme Prize. In 2010, she was named a World Press Freedom Hero of the International Press Institute. When describing her job, she said: "I believe the role of journalism is to be a lantern, allowing society to exercise its right to know and understand; I believe human rights are non-negotiable. As long as I live, I will continue to write, and writing will keep me alive."</p>
    <p><b>The barrier(s) that she is trying to address</b></p>
    <p>Lydia's work as a journalist and her activism as a citizen are intertwined. Through her investigative reporting, Lydia Cacho willingly exposes herself at risk to fight against discrimination, racism, and violence against women and girls by writing it. When trying to achieve human dignity and equality, Cacho's aspiration was full of challenges. Working as a female journalist in Mexico can be dangerous, and being a women's rights activist even more so. In 2005, she released her book "The Demons of Eden" on stories of girls' abuses and pornography in a Cancún beach resort, exposing high-profile politicians and influential businessmen. In her book, Lydia Cacho revealed how several powerful men had been involved in the pederast-pedophile network. She reported on the ties of businessman José Kamel Nacif Borge, El rey de la mezclilla, the "King of Denim," for his jeans’ factories, and Jean Succar Kuri, the owner of a hotel in Cancún who was to be charged with child pornography. Consequently, Lydia was accused of libel and defamation and got arrested by the police in Cancún. During her detention, Lydia suffered several waves of abuse by the public enforcement that she later reported. She has been kidnapped, raped, assaulted, and tortured for 20 hours. She also received 20 death threats over the phone if she did not stop reporting. Nevertheless, Cacho refused to be silenced, and, in 2006, she wrote on the hundreds of female homicides in Ciudad Juárez. The injustices and abuses she suffered acted as a motivational strength to keep forward with her cause and defend her human rights, together with every other girl. In addition, in 2018, her documentary Somos valientes, “We are brave,” was released, which details the effect of violence on Mexican children. For two years, Lydia Cacho, the director of this docuseries, traveled with a team of documentary filmmakers and human rights experts to five different states in the country to talk and interview children about their rights. Afterward, in 2020, she was the host and executive producer of a bilingual podcast about femicide along the border in Ciudad Juárez through interviews with the investigators and the victims' families who tried to solve the crimes. The podcast was called "the Red Note" in English and "La Nota Roja" in Spanish.</p>
    <p><b>The impact on women's empowerment</b></p>
    <p>When Lydia Cacho realized how many women needed help and advice, she decided to start a support group. The support group later evolved into a maximum-security shelter for women and children; a formal institution called El Centro Integral de Atención a las Mujeres, in Cancun. El Centro is a non-profit organization funded by donations whose staff is composed of professionals in defense of victims. Thanks to her high-security shelter, Cacho provides a safe space for survivors of trafficking, domestic violence, and other forms of abuse and exploitation to access health, legal and other support services. El Centro helps the victim with legal assistance, and they take all the cases from the beginning to the end. The survivors can remain in the facility for one year to one year and a half to get the psychological treatment they deserve and protection from the predators. Further, the shelter has the objective to find a safe place for victims of abuse and takes the responsibility to train them to reintegrate into society with work skills to be independent and feel free again. The Cancun center for aid to women and their children has been recognized as one of the best aid centers in Mexico. Lydia’s mission through this shelter is to advocate for the endowment of women in health and education.</p>
    <p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
    <p>In conclusion, promoting gender equality and strengthening women's rights is essential for sustainable development. People like Lydia María Cacho Rìbeiro should serve as an example to overcome inequality. Her work and her bravery helped many girls to come forward and bring their oppressors to justice and take back control of their lives. She dedicated her years as an activist to the cause by deciding to denounce on paper the suffering of women, even if that required putting herself in danger. Through her book, she sent many criminals to prison and gave voice to many victims in different parts of the country. Additionally, after her detention following the publication of “The Demons of Eden,” journalism was decriminalized; hence, journalists could no longer be held accountable for defamation and libel. Her court case, together with the media reaction, and the intervention of political actors, initiated a process of change. Thanks to her book, also legislation concerning child pornography has evolved considerably. Particularly in a country like Mexico, which is one of the most dangerous countries in the world for journalism, the work of Lydia is essential. The prizes she was accredited with and the international visibility she received acted as a shield and provided her protection. To conclude, Lydia Cacho firmly believes in the importance of electronic media and its decisive role in accessing information. She criticizes media monopoly, one of the most significant problems in Mexico, and fight to keep community radio stations alive as they are vital for the freedom of information and to spread the news across the country.</p>`,

    content: `<p>"Tolerance is respect, acceptance and appreciation of the rich diversity of our world's cultures, our forms of expression, and ways of being human." UNESCO's 1995 Declaration of Principles on Tolerance.</p>
    <p>In celebration of International Day of Tolerance, the #InHerShoes/#EnSusZapatos campaign will be sharing this space with our LGBTQAI+ community and their stories of what it means to come out in society. For those that haven’t had the chance to showcase their true essence, we see you and acknowledge the great bravery and courage that comes with accepting yourself fully.</p>
    <p>“Transgender people – and particularly Black and Latina transgender women – are marginalized, stigmatized and criminalized in our country.” said Rodrigo Heng-Lehtinen, deputy executive director for the National Center for Transgender Equality (NCTE). (Stories)</p>
    <p>In countries in Latin America, like Colombia, the life expectancy for a transgnder woman is estimated between 35 and 41 years old (read the article linked in our bio for more information!).  This is not good enough and we need to find solutions to eliminate all violence against all women and work to ensure transgender women, like all women, are also safe to live freely.</p>
    <p>Intersex persons (born with reproductive/sexual anatomy that doesn’t fit the standard of being a female/male) are vulnerable to abuse based on ignorance or bigotry about their bodies. Intersex victims of domestic violence face similar or higher rates when compared to the general population.</p>
    <p>The #InHerShoes/#EnSusZapatos campaign extends beyond cis-hetero women (born biologically in their gender/sex) and aims to spread awareness about violence against womxn+ domestically and globally. Womxn+ is an inclusive term that is used to address cis women, transgender and intersex women, non-binary people, and female-identified individuals. Join our fight for women’s rights and protections by participating in our actions! </p>

    Sometimes we face many problems we never expected, and we do not know how we can solve them.

As an M.A. student in Human Rights at the University of Padova, her studies focus on the impacts of law and policies in protecting women and children from various social risks, especially technology-facilitated sexual violence against women and girls.
    <br/><br/>
    Inspired by a charitable program for orphanage children at her old high school, Anh developed a deep passion for children’s rights. This led her to be involved in many projects in protecting children through quality education. She has launched a comprehensive sexuality education project in Vietnam that covers healthy sexuality, children’s rights, and how to protect yourself from sexual violence in middle school classrooms. Over the years, she has also organized events with 3,000 – 15,000 participants.

After several years, Anh has finally graduated with a degree in Marketing and Communications after having multiple epiphanies about her desired career path. Anh has worked in various sectors of marketing and comms, such as B2B, lingerie, and not-for-profits. In her free time, Anh likes to paint, draw, sculpt, skateboard, and spend an egregious amount of time in The Sims 4 creating the worst houses known to man.
    <br/><br/>
    Anh likes Formula 1, TWICE, and the movie Space Jam: A New Legacy - for which she is a huge advocate. Anh dislikes the Godfather and its sequels. One of Anh's goals is to create and lead a marketing or comms campaign so brilliant future students will have to analyze it. But, if we're honest, she would be happy if only a handful of people resonate with something she created.  
    <br/><br/>
    Anh had previously worked with a non-profit that focused on aiding survivors of sexual violence. There she saw how even a small message of support and encouragement meant the world to the survivors. This is why she decided to volunteer with Educacion Diversa. It doesn't matter if you're one person, you still have the power to make a difference. And she intends to make one with ED, for a better future for women and children.

She enjoys practicing several sports and constantly being surrounded by people that can enrich her personal and professional expertise. She has a strong passion for cultural diversity that served as the reason she chose to attend a linguistic high school in Milan to cultivate the study of French, Spanish, and English literature. Those years were crucial for her personal and academic growth, particularly the penultimate year when she spent a semester abroad as an exchange student in Vancouver. This experience left an indelible mark on her life and pushed her to pursue an international career studying comparative law at the IE University of Madrid.
    <br/><br/>
    During the last four years, she decided to dedicate full-time to studying comparative law to be a member of the honor program of her university. Every year, she undertook a professional experience, starting with the legal clinic, applying, and working as a legal intern for several Italian and Spanish law firms mainly focused on corporate and labor law. The legal background acquired, and the senior lawyers met , taught her to broaden her horizon when facing an intricate legal issue and the added value of working in a group to analyze different solutions by hearing distinct perspectives.  Furthermore, in 2019, she participated in the “Human Rights Moot Court Competition course,” and the past semester, she was enrolled in the class “Human Rights of Women and Girls,” “Gender and Development,” and “Identity, Diversity, and Cross-Cultural Understanding.” Additionally, she recently submitted her final project, which focused on the extraterritorial application of Italian criminal law to punish the perpetrators responsible for committing abuses against hundreds of leftist activists during the dictatorship of the 1970s-1980s in Latin American countries. The subjects studied, and the experiences gained make Beatrice a suitable and valid member for Educación Diversa and its core mission. 
    <br/><br/>
    The educational background has undoubtedly played an important role in redefining the personality and beliefs of Beatrice. Thanks to her law degree, she realized that one of her most fundamental characteristics is a profound sense of justice. The law discipline helped her understand where she wants to stand in society and the active role she wishes to undertake to heal existing inequalities and injustices suffered by minorities. The primary purpose of being a volunteer for Educación Diversa is to raise awareness among people by spreading essential data and information about gender and development, human rights violations, and sexual and reproductive health rights both internationally and domestically.

    <br/><br/>
    It was in the sixteenth year of her life when I was admitted to Farhang high school, the most prestigious national school in her country. The last step in her educational career before entering the university was the challenging university entrance exam. The results were statistically significant as Nikki was placed 25th among 250,000 competitors and eventually, she joined Iran’s National Elites Foundation. This accomplishment provided a great opportunity to start her Bachelor’s degree in law at Tehran University which is one of the top five universities in the country.
    <br/><br/>
    Graduating with 18.04 out of 20 and contributing in research equipped Nikkin with valuable experience and knowledge. After passing the courses like international law and criminal law and achieving the highest possible score in these Bachelor's courses, she had her vision broadened in criminal and business fields.
    <br/><br/>
    This broadened vision became within reach due to the creative projects she has participated in. Ultimately, she conducted a research project entitled Euthanasia in Iran and other countries under the supervision of Dr. Jamshid Gholamloo. The mentioned project was a great help to nurture her teamwork abilities. In addition, working with Dorsa Company on legal projects helped her develop a commercial mindset. Aside from these, her teaching experiences were enhanced via extracurricular activities such as the private tutoring of "Mathematics" and “English” and Arabic" to high school students. Her increasing familiarity with the children’s rights because of doing volunteer work in non-profit organizations provided the incentive behind her participation in projects entitled Children Punishment by Parents in Iranian law and other nations under the supervision of Dr. Mahdavi.
    <br/><br/>
    Nikki humbly mentions that this project was the most significant achievement in her studies. It was a desirable expansion in English knowledge that could be introduced as her prominent achievement.
    <br/><br/>
    Nikki still considers herself an avid quester of knowledge; her endless desire to enter the new areas, and conduct productively scientific research inclined her to work in Education Diversa to help children and adolescents in underdeveloped countries achieve their full potential by providing inclusive education in the areas of human rights, sexual and reproductive health and the elimination of violence.

    bio: `"Greetings from Bhutan, the land of the Thunder Dragon."
    <br/><br/>
    Growing up in a small close-knit environment came with its own set of pros and cons for Regita. While she developed a communal sense of responsibility and inherited the mindset to grow by helping others around her, there were still limitations and restrictions of her agency, and like a bubble, it kept her away from the realities of others in the big world outside her comfort zone. 
    <br/><br/>
    However, being a curious and vocal youth advocate, Regita was keen on using her platform and voice to speak up and be part of dialogues and discourses that impacted the lives and future of the youth.
    Accordingly, her early years of participating and volunteering in programs for youths or youth-led initiatives within her country strengthened her desire to gain globalized exposure and expand her horizon. So she found herself choosing to pursue her undergraduate degree in Politics, Philosophy, and Economics with a minor in Gender Studies in Bangladesh. Living in another country with young girls coming from diverse socio-economic and cultural backgrounds and studying comprehensive liberal arts education really influenced and helped her develop an inclusive perspective and ethics.
    <br/><br/>
    She chose to utilize this acquired knowledge and skills on practical grounds by working with NGOs and organizing educational and engaging programs for marginalized children and youth in Bangladesh and Bhutan even during the pandemic. She also interned at United Nations Bhutan during her final undergrad semester as a Communication and Program Advocacy Intern whereby she involved herself in organizing social campaigns such as a Gender-based violence advocacy campaign. Professionally, she has operated as a Communication and Business development strategist for a digital marketing company, training over 20 Bhutanese youth and working with over 30 Australian businesses, also performing as a national consultant in organizing an Australian-initiated entrepreneurship program for the entrepreneurs in Bhutan while continuing to dedicate her time for the NGOs.
    <br/><br/>
    She has always thrived when she works in a diverse team with equally passionate people working for a cause that they all believe in. At Education Diversa, she wants to connect with other like-minded teammates, learn from them and also share the knowledge she has acquired during her education and in her career while strategizing and developing projects and programs, while also supporting the team to promote its work, its messages to more people through social media advocacy campaigns. By being part of Education Diversa, Regita aspires to be part of a team that is doing the work to create a better world, and a better future by focusing on empowering the future of the world i.e., the children.
